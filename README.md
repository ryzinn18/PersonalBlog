# PersonalBlog
This is my Personal Blog. I have wanted a blog for a while now as a creative outlet and means of expression. I also wanted to gain working Flask experience and saw a great 2 birds with 1 stone opportunity. I took a little time to learn the basics of Flask and applied my knowledge of web development to create this blog. Not only did I gain Flask experience but I also grew my skill sets with CSS and Javascript.

This Blog is relatively simple but that is what I wanted. I have some ideas for additional features or a way to make it more of a social media than a blog by allowing multiple authors. But for my wants/needs with this project, this blog is exactly where it needs to be. I integrated a lot of Javascript for a simple and sleek UI. Most of this sleek functionality is seen when using as a root user, which is restricted to my account. However, there are other features that I think someone with an eye for web development will catch.

If you are reading this, I hope you take a little time to check out the code I have written for this project. I put a strong emphasis on making both the frontend and backend sleek. I restructured the backend code in website/auth.py, website/views.py, and website/static/index.js for optimal functionality and readability in a style very much my own. I also took the time to organize all the HTML in my templates for readablity by giving them clear structure and documentation.
